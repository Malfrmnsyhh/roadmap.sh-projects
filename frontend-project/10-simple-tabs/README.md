# Simple Tabs with Dark Mode

This repository contains a solution for the **"Simple Tabs"** frontend challenge. It demonstrates how to build a dynamic tabbed interface and a theme toggler (Dark/Light mode) within a single HTML file using vanilla JavaScript.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The main objective of this project is to practice DOM manipulation and state management without relying on external libraries or page reloads.

* **Dynamic Content Switching:** Implementing logic to show/hide content sections based on the selected tab using `data-attributes`.
* **State Management:** Managing the "active" state of buttons and content panels using CSS classes.
* **Theme Persistence:** Using `localStorage` to remember the user's preference (Dark or Light mode) even after refreshing the browser.
* **Single File Architecture:** Encapsulating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single efficient file.

## ⚙️ Key Features

* **Interactive Tabs:** Smooth transition between content sections without URL changes.
* **Dark Mode Toggle:** A fully functional switch to toggle between light and dark themes.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
* **Clean UI:** Styled using CSS Variables for easy color management.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and `data-*` attributes for JavaScript hooks.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox, CSS Variables, and Transitions.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Event listeners, DOM manipulation, and LocalStorage API.
