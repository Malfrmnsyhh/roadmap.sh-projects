# Modern Image Grid Layout

This repository contains a solution for the **"Image Grid"** frontend challenge provided by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/image-grid). The project implements a responsive, masonry-style gallery layout using modern CSS techniques.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in **CSS Grid Layout**, specifically focusing on:

* **Complex Grid Architecture:** Constructing a non-uniform grid where specific items span multiple rows (`grid-row: span`) to create a dynamic, masonry-like visual structure.
* **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the layout adapts seamlessly across different viewports, transitioning from a three-column layout on desktop, to two columns on tablets, and a single-column stack on mobile devices.
* **Modern Aesthetics:** Implementing modern styling practices, including `object-fit` for image preservation, `gap` for spacing, and smooth hover transitions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic markup structure.
* **CSS3:** CSS Grid, Flexbox, and Media Queries for responsiveness.
