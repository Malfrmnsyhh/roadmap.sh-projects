# Personal Portfolio Website 🚀

This project is a personal portfolio website built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**. The primary goal of this project is to practice layouting skills, responsiveness, and basic DOM manipulation.

## 🎯 Today's Goals & Achievements

The main focus of today's development was transforming the basic HTML structure into a responsive and elegant design:

### 1. Responsive Layout (Grid & Flexbox)
* **Mobile First Approach:** Ensured a clean look on small screens (mobile) using a stacked layout.
* **CSS Grid System:** Implemented a 3-column layout for the *Projects*, *Experience*, and *Education* sections on Desktop views.
* **Dynamic Borders:** Managed divider lines dynamically (bottom borders for mobile, side borders for desktop).

### 2. Styling & Typography (UI/UX)
* **Font Integration:** Integrated **Poppins** from Google Fonts to achieve a modern and clean aesthetic.
* **Elegant Components:**
    * Designed a pill-shaped *Dark Mode* button with subtle shadows.
    * Applied card-style styling to the project list items.
* **Interactive Hover:** Added smooth transition effects when hovering over buttons or links.

### 3. JavaScript DOM (Dark Mode)
* Implemented a functional **Dark Mode Toggle**.
* Utilized **CSS Variables** (`var(--bg-body)`, etc.) to ensure consistent and smooth color theme transitions.
* Added logic to automatically switch the icon (changing 🌙 to ☀️).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic Elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`).
* **CSS3:** Flexbox, Grid Layout, CSS Variables.
* **JavaScript:** Basic DOM Manipulation (`classList.toggle`, Event Listener).
